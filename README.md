## Abstract ##

This project propose a new localization technique where whenever a new node is 
introduced in an underwater sensor network , \
we will be able to derieve its coordinate only by examining the coordinates of three 
of its nearest neighbours.The nearest \
neighbours will anchor nodes whose coordinates are known and their distance will
be calculated by estimating the round trip time.\
The simulations are to be performed
first on MATLAB and finally on UnetStack. The detailed procedure along with the
background mathematical model is discussed in this report.\
